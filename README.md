# Disbursements Calculation

Let's code!


## Taken steps

* I think about this as an independent Service.
* This service has two main responsabilities: Calculate Disbrusements and expose them via API.
* So, I focus on the first one, and I create the class structure for making a mental map.
    * I create the application layer as an agnostic entry point to the logic
    * I create the domain entities and service
* Now I start coding!
